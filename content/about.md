## Hi :)

I'm something between a software engineer and a researcher.

I like dealing with a lot of data, especially with biology-related data.  
I work at a research institute in Hungary, called [SZTAKI](http://www.sztaki.hu/en).

In my free time I like reading, wandering around in forests, and climbing trees.

If you're interested in my interests, maybe folow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adorster) or [GitHub](https://github.com/ador) or 
[LinkedIn](https://hu.linkedin.com/in/adrienn-szabo-2b510818).

You can also drop me an email, my address is "-ador-" at "proton-mail" plus ".ch", but leave out all the dashes :)
