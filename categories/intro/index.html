    Handling missing values in Scala: Options Whenever we want to use a value that is not readily available yet &ndash; for example, when we call a function to compute or fetch something &ndash; we can not be sure if things go as were planned. What if the database connection is down? What if the user typed in an invalid string? In the Java world, and in many other programming languages, the programmers could throw an exception (or just pass further the &lsquo;classic&rsquo; NullPointerException) in these cases to signal that the requested value cold not be served.  <a href="http://hands-on-scala.github.io/post/options/">Read More...</a>

    Basic data structures in Scala: Maps After Lists and tuples, let&rsquo;s have a look at Maps. They are sometimes called &ldquo;hashtables&rdquo;, &ldquo;hashes&rdquo;, or &ldquo;dictionaries&rdquo; in other programming languages. Maps are a bit more complex than what we&rsquo;ve seen before. They come handy when you need to store associated pairs of data, or when you need to easily look up a value corresponding to another value (which we will call the key).  <a href="http://hands-on-scala.github.io/post/maps/">Read More...</a>

    Basic data structures in Scala: Tuples In the previous post we learned about Lists in Scala. Now I&rsquo;ll briefly cover tuples. You can think about a tuple as simple &ldquo;wrapper&rdquo; around a handful of things, it just keeps its elements together, at their own place. Tuples are similar to lists in some ways, but there are also some key differences. It is also worth noting that strictly speaking, a tuple is not a Scala collection, because it&rsquo;s not one of the classes that implement the necessary functionality to be called a real collection.  <a href="http://hands-on-scala.github.io/post/tuples/">Read More...</a>

    Basic data structures in Scala: Lists In the following couple of posts we&rsquo;ll learn about basic data structures, and how they can be used in Scala. Lists are what their name suggests: they can keep a list of things. The order of its elements will be kept, and a list does not care if an element appears more than once in it. Creating (immutable) lists As it can be read in the Scala collections overview, collections in Scala can either be mutable or immutable.  <a href="http://hands-on-scala.github.io/post/lists/">Read More...</a>

    What is a coding dojo? In short, a coding dojo is an event where a group of programmers practice their craft in an organized way, focusing on a single coding problem. A dojo usually lasts a couple of hours, depending on the style and the task to be solved. For more details see CodingDojo.org or Joe Wright&rsquo;s blog post about coding dojos. We usually do a Randori Kata version, where the task is solved by a team of 4-6 people, who take 5-7 minute turns in pairs.  <a href="http://hands-on-scala.github.io/post/dojo1/">Read More...</a>

    Why test our code? This is a more &lsquo;practical&rsquo; topic, and I&rsquo;m sure that many would argue that learning how to use a unit testing framework is not strictly necessary for newcomers. But according to my experience, getting into the habit of writing tests regularly quickly pays off. Why? It&rsquo;s nicely summarized here, I&rsquo;m just listing here the main points: Regression Testing Improve The Implementation Via New Insights It Saves Time, Really Self-Updating Documentation It Is Fun Testing frameworks for Scala In Scala, you basically have two main-stream options if you want to write unit tests for your code: ScalaTest Specs2 We&rsquo;ll explore the first one, the ScalaTest framework in this short post, through some basic examples.  <a href="http://hands-on-scala.github.io/post/testing1/">Read More...</a>

    Why should we care about pattern matching? Pattern matching is a quite commonly used &ldquo;programming pattern&rdquo; in functional languages, because it fits nicely into the &ldquo;functional way of thinking&rdquo;, and it is quite powerful and handy as a tool. It&rsquo;s somewhat similar to a sequence of if / else statements or to the switch statement of Java or C, but it is much more powerful, because it lets you form more complex conditions for matching, even for the inside of an object.  <a href="http://hands-on-scala.github.io/post/patternmatch1/">Read More...</a>

    Enumerations - what are they for? Generally in programming, enumerations (a.k.a. enums) are light-weight means to create a very simple model within our code, for representing a custom type with a limited set of possible values with readable names. This description might sound a bit too abstract, so let&rsquo;s see an example instead. Example: days of week Let&rsquo;s introduce an enum for representing the days of week. In Scala, you have to create an object for this, which needs to extend Scala&rsquo;s Enumeration trait (we&rsquo;ll learn more about objects and traits later).  <a href="http://hands-on-scala.github.io/post/enums/">Read More...</a>

    Welcome! You&rsquo;re probably here because you&rsquo;ve heard that Scala is a cool programming language that you&rsquo;d like to learn. Because, hey, it&rsquo;s object-oriented and functional at the same time! I&rsquo;ll show you something very basic at first: a bit more &ldquo;personal&rdquo; version of the famous &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; program. The following little Scala program will ask for your name and then it&rsquo;ll print &ldquo;Hello, !&rdquo; to the console. object WordApp extends App { val name = scala.io.StdIn.readLine(&quot;What&#39;s your name?  <a href="http://hands-on-scala.github.io/post/setup/">Read More...</a>
